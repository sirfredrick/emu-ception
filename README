Unless you have a POSIX compliant OS with access to GNU make and devkitpro and
know how to compile software from source then just use the prebuilt files. Since
they are run in an emulator this will work on any operating system that can run
dolphin-emu.

Emu-ception A 4 layer deep emulation experience AKA the best way to play PONG

This project consists of NES-CHIP-8 a CHIP-8 emulator for the NES, PocketNES a
NES emulator for the GBA, and VBA GX a GBA emulator for the Gamecube and Wii.

Running

The easiest way to run this project is to move the sd.raw file into the Wii
directory inside the dolphin emulator directory. The default location for this
is "C:\\Users\<Username>\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Wii" on Windows,
"~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin/Wii" on macOS, and
"~/.local/share/dolphin-emu/Wii" or "~/.dolphin-emu/Wii" on Linux.

Then go to Config->Audio->DSP Emulator Engine and select DSP LLE recompiler so
you can listen to the sick tunes!

Next, click on Open and select the vbagx-wii.elf file you should now be booted
into the VBA GX emulator. Next, navigate to your SD card and select the chip.gba
file to start playing PONG!

Building
